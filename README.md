# Creditcard_Fraud_Detection

## Project Introduction
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is a machine learning - based initiative aimed at identifying credit card fraud by analyzing historical transaction data. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly logistic regression and random forest algorithms, to conduct in - depth analysis of transaction data, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection.

## Project Background
With the growing prevalence of e - commerce, credit cards have become the primary payment method for online transactions. However, the rising incidence of credit card fraud has posed significant economic challenges to both financial institutions and consumers. Traditional fraud detection methods rely on rules and manual reviews, which are inefficient and prone to oversight. Recent advancements in machine learning have offered new solutions for credit card fraud detection, enabling the analysis of vast amounts of historical transaction data to identify complex patterns and anomalies.

## Feature Description
* **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean credit card transaction data, handle missing and abnormal values, and perform feature engineering to extract useful features.
* **Feature Selection**: Evaluate feature importance using the random forest algorithm and select features that have the most significant impact on fraud detection.
* **Data Visualization**: Use dimensionality reduction techniques such as t - SNE, PCA, and TSVD to project high - dimensional data into low - dimensional space, facilitating better data distribution understanding.
* **Data Balancing**: Address the class imbalance in the dataset using the SMOTE algorithm to improve the model's ability to identify minority classes (fraudulent transactions).
* **Model Training**: Train fraud detection models using logistic regression and random forest algorithms and optimize model parameters through grid search.
* **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as the confusion matrix and precision - recall curves, analyzing the model's performance at different thresholds.

## Project Advantages
- Enhances the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection through machine learning algorithms.
- Employs various dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques to aid in data structure understanding.

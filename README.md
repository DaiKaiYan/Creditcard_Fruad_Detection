# Creditcard_Fruad_Detection

## Project Introduction
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is a machine learning - based initiative aimed at identifying credit card fraud by analyzing historical transaction data. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly logistic regression and random forest algorithms, to conduct in - depth analysis of transaction data, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection.

## Project Background
With the growing prevalence of e - commerce, credit cards have become the primary payment method for online transactions. However, the rising incidence of credit card fraud has posed significant economic challenges to both financial institutions and consumers. Traditional fraud detection methods rely on rules and manual reviews, which are inefficient and prone to oversight. Recent advancements in machine learning have offered new solutions for credit card fraud detection, enabling the analysis of vast amounts of historical transaction data to identify complex patterns and anomalies.

## Feature Description
* **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean credit card transaction data, handle missing and abnormal values, and perform feature engineering to extract useful features.
